# TriviaGame
In this second jQuery homework assignment, I built a web application that provides a two-minute brain exercise. Twenty-five multiple choice questions are provided for the player, and he/she can answer as many within the 120 seconds. Player can click the "I'm Done!" button if finished before the 120 seconds, or the computer may end the game if time lapses. At the end of the quiz, player result is displayed including the stat: number of questions correctly answered, incorrectly answered, and skipped. On the final screen, player is provided with an option to re-take the quiz.
