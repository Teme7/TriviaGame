# TriviaGame
In this second jQuery homework assignment, I built a web application that provides a light-weight exercise for the brain. Twenty-five multiple choice questions are provided for the player, and he/she can answer as many as possible within 120 seconds. Player can click the "I'm Done!" button if finished before time, or the computer may stop the game when lapses. At the end of the quiz, player result will be displayed including the stat: number of questions correctly answered, incorrectly answered, and skipped. On the final screen, player is provided with an option to re-take the quiz.
